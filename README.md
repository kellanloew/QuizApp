## Potential improvements
Trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project

Currently, the quiz onyl shows the user's score at the end. An improvement would be to additionally show the user a list of which questions they got wrong and right.
Since there is no concept of a database user entity in this project, the quiz taker's answer choices are saved in the same table as the questions and answers themselves. If the concept of a user were added, another table could be created which woudl reference the question and answer tables, and here instead the user's quiz data could be kept.
